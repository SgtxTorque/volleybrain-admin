# CLAUDE.md — VolleyBrain Web Admin Portal

## CRITICAL CONTEXT

This is the **web admin portal** for VolleyBrain, a dual-platform youth sports management app.
- **This repo**: `volleybrain-admin` — React/Vite web app (admin portal)
- **Sister repo**: `volleybrain-mobile3` — React Native/Expo mobile app
- **Shared backend**: Supabase (project ID: `uqpjvbiuokwpldjvxiby`)
- **Both apps share the same database** — any schema changes affect both platforms

## ⛔ MANDATORY RULES — EVERY SESSION

These rules apply to EVERY change you make, no exceptions:

### Do Not Break What Works
- **NEVER delete or overwrite existing page components** — modify them, don't replace them
- **NEVER change Supabase queries or data logic** unless the task specifically requires it
- **NEVER modify the theme/styling system** (ThemeContext, accent colors, dark/light mode) unless asked
- **NEVER alter the auth flow** (AuthContext, login, role detection) unless asked
- **NEVER drop or alter existing database tables/columns** — only ADD new ones. If a column needs to change, create a new one and migrate

### Test Before Finishing
- After every change, verify the app still starts with `npm run dev` without errors
- Check the browser console for errors — fix any red errors before finishing
- If you modified navigation, verify ALL pages are still reachable
- If you touched a Supabase query, verify it returns data (no 404s, no empty responses from missing tables)

### Git Discipline
- **Commit AND push after every completed sprint or feature** — not one giant commit at the end
- Commit messages must describe WHAT changed. Good: `"Phase 1: Add react-router-dom routing to all 25+ pages"`. Bad: `"updates"` or `"changes"`
- Format: `"Phase X: [what changed]"` so the git log reads like a changelog
- Run `git add -A && git commit -m "Phase X: ..." && git push` after each meaningful milestone
- If a session covers multiple sprints, commit after EACH sprint, not just at the end

### Communication
- If you're unsure about something, STOP and explain the options before proceeding
- If a task seems like it will break existing functionality, warn Carlos first
- If a Supabase table or column referenced in the code doesn't seem to exist, flag it — don't guess

### Schema Safety
- Both web and mobile share the same Supabase backend
- NEVER run DROP TABLE, DROP COLUMN, or destructive ALTER statements
- Always use IF NOT EXISTS when creating tables or columns
- If you need to verify a table exists, query information_schema — don't just assume

## OWNER CONTEXT

- Carlos cannot code — all implementation is done via Claude Code
- Carlos is the director of Black Hornets Volleyball Club in Dallas
- Organization ID: `b213e885-093f-47d8-afca-b305a75b3274`
- User ID: `8e9894f6-59d7-47a1-8dc4-c2271a5e9275`

## TECH STACK

- React 18.2 + Vite 5
- Tailwind CSS 3.4
- Supabase JS 2.39
- Lucide React icons 0.294
- react-router-dom 6.21 (**INSTALLED but NOT USED** — see Phase 1 task)
- No TypeScript — all .jsx files

```

## CURRENT NAVIGATION SYSTEM (IMPORTANT)

**The app does NOT use react-router-dom for navigation.** Despite it being installed in package.json.

All page navigation happens via `useState` in `MainApp.jsx`:
```javascript
const [page, setPage] = useState('dashboard')  // Line ~1776
```

Pages render conditionally:
```javascript
{page === 'dashboard' && activeView === 'admin' && <DashboardPage onNavigate={setPage} />}
{page === 'registrations' && <RegistrationsPage showToast={showToast} />}
// ... etc for all 25+ pages
```

Navigation is organized into dropdown menus in `HorizontalNavBar` (line ~1430):
- **Admin**: Dashboard | People (Teams, Coaches) | Operations (Registrations, Jerseys, Schedule, Attendance, Payments, Coach Availability) | Game Day (Game Prep, Standings, Leaderboards) | Communication (Chats, Announcements, Push Notifications) | Insights (Reports, Registration Funnel, Season Archives, Org Directory) | Setup (Seasons, Registration Forms, Waivers, Payment Setup, Organization, Data Export, Subscription)
- **Coach**: Dashboard | My Teams (dynamic team list) | Schedule | My Availability | Game Day | Attendance | Communication | Insights
- **Parent**: Home | My Players (dynamic child list) | Schedule | Standings | Leaderboards | Achievements | Chats | Payments | Archives | Directory
- **Player**: Home | My Teams (dynamic) | Schedule | Standings | Leaderboards | Achievements

Role switching happens via a role selector in the header. The current role is stored in `activeView` state.

## DESIGN SYSTEM

- **Theme**: CSS custom property `--accent-primary` for brand color, dark/light mode toggle
- **Card style**: iOS-inspired glassmorphism with `backdrop-blur`, `border-white/[0.06]` in dark mode
- **Layout**: 3-column grid on dashboard, split-panel for chat, data tables for admin pages
- **Patterns**: Toast notifications for feedback, modals for detail/edit views, dropdown menus for nav

## SUPABASE TABLES USED BY WEB

Key tables queried in the web codebase (see DATABASE_SCHEMA.md for full schema):

**Core**: organizations, profiles, seasons, sports, teams, players, team_players, team_coaches, coaches, user_roles
**Schedule**: schedule_events (aliased as 'schedule' in some queries), event_rsvps, event_volunteers
**Payments**: payments, payment_plans, payment_plan_installments, registration_fees
**Chat**: chat_channels, channel_members, chat_messages, message_attachments, message_reactions
**Blasts**: messages, message_recipients, announcements, announcement_reads
**Team Wall**: team_posts, post_reactions, team_post_comments (comments + threaded replies)
**Game**: games, game_sets, game_stats, game_lineups, game_lineup_players
**Jerseys**: jerseys, jersey_assignments, jersey_change_requests
**Waivers**: waivers, waiver_signatures
**Achievements**: achievements, player_achievements, achievement_categories, player_achievement_progress
**Engagement**: shoutouts, shoutout_categories, coach_challenges, challenge_participants, xp_ledger
**Notifications**: admin_notifications, notification_templates, push_subscriptions
**Registration**: registration_templates, registration_custom_fields

## KNOWN ISSUES

2. ~~**RLS disabled**~~ — RESOLVED in Phase 5 Sprint 5.3 (RLS migration + org_id scoping audit)
3. ~~**SchedulePage.jsx is 4,200 lines**~~ — RESOLVED in Phase 5 Sprint 5.4 (split to 3,823 lines + CalendarViews.jsx + scheduleHelpers.jsx)
4. ~~**OrganizationPage.jsx is 2,400 lines**~~ — RESOLVED in Phase 5 Sprint 5.4 (split to 813 lines + SetupSectionCard.jsx + SetupSectionContent.jsx)
5. **ParentMessagesPage.jsx is 81 lines** — stub/placeholder
6. **InviteFriendsPage.jsx is 84 lines** — stub/placeholder
7. ~~**src_backup/ folder**~~ — RESOLVED in Phase 5 Sprint 5.4 (removed from tracking + .gitignore)
8. ~~**90MB supabase.exe**~~ — RESOLVED in Phase 5 Sprint 5.4 (removed from tracking + .gitignore)
9. ~~**post_reactions vs team_post_reactions**~~ — RESOLVED: web uses 'post_reactions' (confirmed)
10. ~~**Toast.jsx is 28 lines**~~ — RESOLVED in Phase 1 Sprint 1.2 (stacking, animations, progress bar)
